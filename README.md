# Swol

## Short Description of App

Swol is an application that intentionally makes working out a social experience. Too often, people feel unmotivated to self-start their workouts and fitness journeys. They feel more comfortable in group settings, pushing themselves to catch up to or even surpass their peers, encouraging others to not fall behind, and having an overall more effective experience. Swol meets this need by connecting those who do not necessarily have others around to workout with to those who are willing and able to welcome in new workout buddies. The intention is to give each user an individualized experience, based on location and preferences, while the goal is to create a platform for shared exercise experiences.

Swol gives people the ability to create workouts of their own, and broadcast those workouts on a feed for Swol users to see. People with comparable interests and goals choose to join the workouts that fit their own needs and interests, and all participants meet up to actually engage in said activities. People then have the ability to rate the workouts, describe their experiences, add photos, and share their experience with the larger Swol community post-workout.
